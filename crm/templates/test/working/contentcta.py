The Black & Gold muted Estadio BBVA with a spectacular performance and booked a ticket to the CONCACAF Champions Cup Final after smashing Rayados 3-1 (5-2 on aggregate) at their home Wednesday evening.\n\nThe Crew enjoyed an electric start and found some spaces to test Rayadosâ€™ goalkeeper Esteban Andrada.\n\nForward Cucho Hernandez had a long-distance shot in the first minute that went slightly wide.\n\nHowever, things turned tough when unexpectedly Rayados hit first in the 10th minute. Midfielder Maxi Meza controlled a long pass and put it over Crewâ€™s goalkeeper Patrick Schulte. His shot came off the crossbar, but defender Yevhen Cheberko couldnâ€™t slow his pace and tallied an own goal to give the hosts an early lead.\n\nDespite the situation, the MLS champions kept composure and possession of the ball for the next few minutes but could not find open spaces and hurt Rayados.\n\nIn the 19th minute, a late run by midfielder Luis Romo into the box almost extended the Monterrey lead, but the header went just above the crossbar.\n\nBy that time of the game, Rayadosâ€™ pressure forced Crew to go back deep in the field and turn over the ball.\n\nFollowing a long time with little to no action, Andradaâ€™s huge mistake opened a window for the Crew.\n\nIn the fourth minute of added time in the first half, after catching a crossed ball, Andrada succumbed to the crowdâ€™s pressure and gave the ball to the wrong teammate.\n\nMorris was paying more attention than anyone else on the field and quickly won the challenge to get possession of the ball and score the equalizer before going to halftime.\n\nThe crowd was not even back to their seats when the Black & Gold scored the second goal.

He found Matan who moved the ball on to a fresh Russell-Rowe for the final goal of the match.\n\nChristian Ramirez was fouled in the last moments of play by Andrada, and after a quick VAR review, a penalty kick was called.\n\nAndrada guessed Ramirezâ€™s shot and saved the attempt as the final whistle blew.\n\nColumbus Crew took on two of the most important teams in Mexico and made their way to the CONCACAF Champions final.

They beat Guatemala\'s Comunicaciones 7-1 in round one and then two MLS sides before meeting the Crew -- a 3-1 win over FC Cincinnati in the round of 16 and a 5-2 win over Inter Miami in the quarterfinals. American forward Brandon Vazquez has been their top goalscorer in the competition with four goals, including one in the second leg against Miami. They played a fairly even match against the Crew at Lower.com Field last week despite coming out with a one-goal disadvantage, which could be encouraging on home turf.\n\nColumbus Crew: The Crew have already made their deepest-ever run in the competition but no doubt have their sights set on going at least one step further -- and perhaps going all the way. Things have been much tighter for them than it has for Monterrey, though, partially due to the fact that the Champions Cup kicked off just as the MLS season did. They beat the Houston Dynamo 2-1 in the round of 16 before advancing on penalties against Tigres in the quarterfinals, and again face another closely contested matchup on Wednesday. The first leg against Monterrey ultimately favored them -- they out-possessed, outshot and out-passed the opposition -- but the big question for them is if they can do so again away from home.\n\nPrediction\n\nBoth teams enter the matchup in somewhat inconsistent form but expect another competitive matchup that could swing either way. Monterrey likely have the edge because of the home field advantage, but this one could require extra time to settle the score. Pick: Monterrey 2, Columbus Crew 0 (after extra time)']
