They beat Guatemala\'s Comunicaciones 7-1 in round one and then two MLS sides before meeting the Crew -- a 3-1 win over FC Cincinnati in the round of 16 and a 5-2 win over Inter Miami in the quarterfinals. American forward Brandon Vazquez has been their top goalscorer in the competition with four goals, including one in the second leg against Miami. They played a fairly even match against the Crew at Lower.com Field last week despite coming out with a one-goal disadvantage, which could be encouraging on home turf.\n\nColumbus Crew: The Crew have already made their deepest-ever run in the competition but no doubt have their sights set on going at least one step further -- and perhaps going all the way. Things have been much tighter for them than it has for Monterrey, though, partially due to the fact that the Champions Cup kicked off just as the MLS season did. They beat the Houston Dynamo 2-1 in the round of 16 before advancing on penalties against Tigres in the quarterfinals, and again face another closely contested matchup on Wednesday. The first leg against Monterrey ultimately favored them -- they out-possessed, outshot and out-passed the opposition -- but the big question for them is if they can do so again away from home.\n\nPrediction\n\nBoth teams enter the matchup in somewhat inconsistent form but expect another competitive matchup that could swing either way. Monterrey likely have the edge because of the home field advantage, but this one could require extra time to settle the score. Pick: Monterrey 2, Columbus Crew 0 (after extra time)']

**Pre-Match Buildup and First Half:**

The highly anticipated rematch between Columbus and Monterrey kicked off with both teams eager to cement their place in the final. The Crew, buoyed by their 2-1 victory in the first leg, displayed an attacking mindset from the get-go. Cucho Hernandez, the Colombian forward, unleashed a threatening shot in the opening minute, hinting at the Crew's relentless spirit.

However, it was Monterrey who struck first, capitalizing on a moment of misfortune. In the 11th minute, a cross from Maxi Meza deflected off the crossbar and then off Crew defender Yevhen Cheberko, resulting in an unfortunate own goal. The home crowd erupted in cheers, but the Crew remained composed and refused to let the setback dampen their spirits.

**Second Half Surge and Victory:**

The second half witnessed a resurgence from the Crew, who refused to be denied. A costly mistake by Monterrey goalkeeper Esteban Andrada in the dying seconds of the half proved to be a game-changer. Aidan Morris, the Crew's opportunistic midfielder, pounced on a loose ball and fired a clinical shot into the bottom corner, tying the match just before the break.

The Crew continued to dominate the second half, with Diego Rossi and Jacen Russell-Rowe putting the game beyond Monterrey's reach with well-executed goals in the 49th and 89th minutes, respectively. Despite several attempts, Monterrey could not find a way to overcome the Crew's resolute defense, marshaled by goalkeeper Patrick Schulte.
