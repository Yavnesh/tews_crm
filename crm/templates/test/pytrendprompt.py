"""
Assume you have a program where 
Input: Any Topic, time frame, region
Output: interest Overtime*, interest By Region*, related Queries, related Topics
* This can vary as per the input time frame and region respectively

I have to write a research paper to Design an in depth logic to find best possible keywords which have high interest for the given input topic.
Note: 1. Be Creative and apply Data Analysis
2. If you will input any item from relateQueries or relatedTopics then you will get the output as per the program.
3. Make a list of top 5 keywords which can be used for particular topic
4. Data Acquisition - Google Trends
5. For Data Analysis - Make use of Interest Over Time, Interest by Region, Identify High-Interest Keywords, Refine Keyword Selection in depth.
6.  Get meaningful interpretations from interest Over Time Visualisation (use at least 3 time frames)
7. Make use of Topic Modelling
8. write a python code to automate this 
9. For each function provide logic which can be used directly
10. incorporates advanced techniques for high-accuracy keyword research, leveraging insights and addressing identified limitations
11.
